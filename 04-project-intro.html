<p>The scientific process is naturally incremental and many projects start life as random notes, some code, then a manuscript, and eventually everything is a bit mixed together.</p>

Most people tend to organize their projects like this:

![](fig/bad_layout.png)

There are many reasons why we should *ALWAYS* avoid this:

1. It is really hard to tell which version of your data is
the original and which is the modified;
2. It gets really messy because it mixes files with various
extensions together;
3. It probably takes you a lot of time to actually find
things, and relate the correct figures to the exact code
that has been used to generate it;

-->
<p>A good project layout will make your life easier by:</p>
<ul>
<li>ensuring the integrity of your data;</li>
<li>making it simpler to share the code with peers;</li>
<li>allowing you to easily upload your code with your manuscript submission;</li>
<li>enabling you to pick the project up again after a break hassle-free.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="a-possible-solution">A possible solution</h3>
<p>Fortunately, there are tools and packages which can help you manage your work effectively.</p>
<p>One of the most powerful and useful aspects of RStudio is the project management functionality. We’ll be using this today to create a self-contained, reproducible project.</p>

<div class="panel-heading">
<h4 id="challenge-creating-a-self-contained-project"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-pencil"></span>Challenge: Creating a self-contained project</h4>
</div>
<div class="panel-body">
<p>We’re going to create a new project in RStudio:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Click the “File” menu button, then “New Project”.</li>
<li>Click “New Directory”.</li>
<li>Click “Empty Project”.</li>
<li>Type in the name of the directory to store your project, e.g. “test_project”.</li>
<li>Make sure that the checkbox for “Create a git repository” is selected.</li>
<li>Click the “Create Project” button.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</section>
<p>Now when we start R in this project directory, or open this project with RStudio, all of our work on this project will be entirely self-contained in this directory.</p>
<h4 id="version-control">Version Control</h4>
<p>We also set up our project to integrate with git, putting it under version control. RStudio has an interface to git, but is very limited in what it can do. Let’s make an initial commit of our template files.</p>
<p>The top right panel in RStudio has a tab for “Git”. When files are not yet tracked by git these are marked by yellow question marks. Now our project has two items untracked:</p>
<ul>
<li>.gitignore (automatically generated by git)</li>
<li>test_project.Rproj (automatically generated by RStudio)</li>
</ul>
<p>Stage these two files by selecting them in the Git tab and pressing <code>Commit</code>. On the pop up window in the <code>Comment</code> box type: “Adding .gitgnore and test_proj.Rproj files”. Press <code>Commit</code>, then <code>Close</code> on the pop up window and then close the last pop up window too.</p>
<h3 id="best-practices-for-project-organisation">Best practices for project organisation</h3>
<p>Although there is no “best” way to lay out a project, there are some general principles to adhere to that will make project management easier:</p>
<h4 id="treat-data-as-read-only">Treat data as read only</h4>
<p>This is probably the most important goal of setting up a project. Data is typically time consuming and/or expensive to collect. Working with them interactively (e.g., in Excel) where they can be modified means you are never sure of where the data came from, or how it has been modified since collection. It is therefore a good idea to treat your data as “read-only”.</p>
<h4 id="data-preprocessing">Data preprocessing</h4>
<p>In many cases your data will be “dirty”: it will need significant preprocessing to get into a R format (or any other programming language). It is often useful to store these scripts in a separate folder, and create a second “read-only” data folder to hold the “processed” data sets.</p>
<h4 id="treat-generated-output-as-disposable">Treat generated output as disposable</h4>
<p>Anything generated by your scripts should be treated as disposable: it should all be able to be regenerated from your scripts.</p>

> #### Tip: ProjectTemplate - a possible solution {.callout}
>
> One way to automate the management of projects is to install the third-party package, `ProjectTemplate`.
> This package will set up an ideal directory structure for project management.
> This is very useful as it enables you to have your analysis pipeline/workflow organised and structured.
> Together with the default RStudio project functionality and Git you will be able to keep track of your
> work as well as be able to share your work with collaborators.
>
> 1. Install `ProjectTemplate`.
> 2. Load the library
> 3. Initialise the project:
>
> 
> ~~~{.r}
> install.packages("ProjectTemplate")
> library(ProjectTemplate)
> create.project("../my_project", merge.strategy = "allow.non.conflict")
> ~~~
>

#### Separate function definition and application

The most effective way I find to work in R, is to play around in the interactive
session, then copy commands across to a script file when I'm sure they work and
do what I want. You can also save all the commands you've entered using the
`history` command, but I don't find it useful because when I'm typing its 90%
trial and error.

When your project is new and shiny, the script file usually contains many lines
of directly executed code. As it matures, reusable chunks get pulled into their
own functions. It's a good idea to separate these into separate folders; one
to store useful functions that you'll reuse across analyses and projects, and
one to store the analysis scripts.

> #### Tip: avoiding duplication {.callout}
>
> You may find yourself using data or analysis scripts across several projects.
> Typically you want to avoid duplication to save space and avoid having to
> make updates to code in multiple places.
>
> In this case I find it useful to make "symbolic links", which are essentially
> shortcuts to files somewhere else on a filesystem. On Linux and OS X you can
> use the `ln -s` command, and on windows you can either create a shortcut or
> use the `mklink` command from the windows terminal.

<h3 id="create-data-directory-and-store-the-data">Create data directory and store the data</h3>
<p>First step for our project is to generate a new folder, called <code>data</code>, and store the raw data files under it.</p>
<section class="challenge panel panel-success">
<div class="panel-heading">
<h4 id="challenge-1"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-pencil"></span>Challenge 1</h4>

<div class="panel-body">
<p>To create a new folder:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>On the bottom right panel click the <code>New Folder</code> button.</p></li>
<li><p>In the popup window type the name of the new folder.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>To download the gapminder data from <a href="http://tinyurl.com/gapminder-FiveYearData-csv">this link</a>, you would have typically used the <code>wget</code> function in the shell. In that case the command would be: <code>wget http://tinyurl.com/gapminder-FiveYearData-csv</code>.</p>
<p>To run a shell command in R we can use the <code>system</code> function. Look at the arguments of the command in the help page and then:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Use the R function <code>system</code> to run the shell command wget from the link above. To save the file under the recently created <code>data</code> folder, add the following flag <code>--output-document=data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv</code> to the above <code>wget</code> function.</p></li>
<li><p>Click on the data folder (bottom right panel) to check if a new file exists.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We will load, inspect and analyse these data later.</p>
</div>
</section>
<p>Check the <code>Git</code> tab for any changes. What do you see?</p>

<p>Generally you do not want to version disposable output or read-only data. You should modify the <code>.gitignore</code> file to tell git to ignore these files and directories.</p>
