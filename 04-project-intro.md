### Introduction

The scientific process is naturally incremental and many projects
start life as random notes, some code, then a manuscript, and
eventually everything is a bit mixed together.

Most people tend to organize their projects like this:

![](fig/bad_layout.png)

There are many reasons why we should *ALWAYS* avoid this:

1. It is really hard to tell which version of your data is
the original and which is the modified;
2. It gets really messy because it mixes files with various
extensions together;
3. It probably takes you a lot of time to actually find
things, and relate the correct figures to the exact code
that has been used to generate it;

-->

A good project layout will make your life easier by:

* ensuring the integrity of your data;
* making it simpler to share the code with peers;
* allowing you to easily upload your code with your manuscript submission;
* enabling you to pick the project up again after a break hassle-free.

### A possible solution

Fortunately, there are tools and packages which can help you manage your work effectively.

One of the most powerful and useful aspects of RStudio is the project management functionality. We'll be using this today to create a self-contained, reproducible project.


> #### Challenge: Creating a self-contained project {.challenge}
>
> We're going to create a new project in RStudio:
>
> 1. Click the "File" menu button, then "New Project".
> 2. Click "New Directory".
> 3. Click "Empty Project".
> 4. Type in the name of the directory to store your project, e.g. "my_project".
> 5. Make sure that the checkbox for "Create a git repository" is selected.
> 6. Click the "Create Project" button.
>

Now when we start R in this project directory, or open this project with RStudio,
all of our work on this project will be entirely self-contained in this directory.

### Best practices for project organisation

Although there is no "best" way to lay out a project, there are some general
principles to adhere to that will make project management easier:

#### Treat data as read only

This is probably the most important goal of setting up a project. Data is
typically time consuming and/or expensive to collect. Working with them
interactively (e.g., in Excel) where they can be modified means you are never
sure of where the data came from, or how it has been modified since collection.
It is therefore a good idea to treat your data as "read-only".

#### Data preprocessing

In many cases your data will be "dirty": it will need significant preprocessing
to get into a R format (or any other programming language). It is often useful to store these scripts
in a separate folder, and create a second "read-only" data folder to hold the
"processed" data sets.

#### Treat generated output as disposable

Anything generated by your scripts should be treated as disposable: it should
all be able to be regenerated from your scripts.

> One way to automate the management of projects is to install the third-party package, `ProjectTemplate`.
> This package will set up an ideal directory structure for project management.
> This is very useful as it enables you to have your analysis pipeline/workflow organised and structured.
> Together with the default RStudio project functionality and Git you will be able to keep track of your
> work as well as be able to share your work with collaborators.

> install.packages("ProjectTemplate")
> library(ProjectTemplate)
> create.project("../my_project", merge.strategy = "allow.non.conflict")
> ~~~

#### Separate function definition and application

The most effective way I find to work in R, is to play around in the interactive
session, then copy commands across to a script file when I'm sure they work and
do what I want. You can also save all the commands you've entered using the
`history` command, but I don't find it useful because when I'm typing its 90%
trial and error.

When your project is new and shiny, the script file usually contains many lines
of directly executed code. As it matures, reusable chunks get pulled into their
own functions. It's a good idea to separate these into separate folders; one
to store useful functions that you'll reuse across analyses and projects, and
one to store the analysis scripts.

### Create data directory and store the data

First step for our project is to generate a new folder, called `data`, and store the data files under it.

> #### Challenge 1 {.challenge}
> To create a new folder:
>
> 1. On the bottom right panel click the `New Folder` button.
>
> 2. In the popup window type the name of the new folder.
> 
> To download the gapminder data from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/makostadima/r-novice-intermediate-cambridge-june2015/gh-pages/data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv):
>
> 1. Use the R function `system` to run the shell command wget from the link above, using the option `--output-document=data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv`
>
> 2. Click on the data folder (bottom right panel) to check if a new file exists.
>
> We will load, inspect and analyse these data later.

#### Version Control

We also set up our project to integrate with git, putting it under version control.
RStudio has an interface to git, but is very limited in what it can
do. Let's make an initial commit of our template files.

The workspace/history pane has a tab for "Git". We can stage each file by checking the box:

you will see a Green "A" next to stage files and folders, and yellow question marks next to
files or folders git doesn't know about yet. RStudio also nicely shows you the difference
between files from different commits.


> #### Tip: versioning disposable output {.callout}
>
> Generally you do not want to version disposable output or read-only data.
> You should modify the `.gitignore` file to tell git to ignore these files
> and directories.
>

> #### Challenge 2 {.challenge}
>
> 1. Modify the `.gitignore` file to contain `data/`
> so that the data folder isn't versioned.
>
> 2. Stage and commit the .gitignore and <project name>.Rproj files using the
> R git interface.
