title: R for reproducible scientific analysis
---

Introduction to R for novice programmers.

The goal of this lesson is to teach novice programmers to write modular code, 
independent of programming language. 

[R](http://www.r-project.org/) was chosen because it is an open source, cross 
platform software environment 
popular across different disciplines for statistical analysis and graphics. R 
comes with an extensive list of third-party packages and documentation, driven 
by a highly active developers community.

The emphasis of these materials is to give attendees a strong foundation in the 
fundamentals of R, and to teach best practices for scientific computing, such as 
breaking down analyses into modular units, task automation, and encapsulation.

Note that this workshop will not teach any statistical analysis.

Disclaimer: A variety of third party packages are used throughout this workshop. 
These are not necessarily the best, nor are they comprehensive, but they are 
packages we find useful, and have been chosen primarily for their usability.
